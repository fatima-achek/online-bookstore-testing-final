## Overview

Through systematic performance testing using **timeit** and **cProfile** (as required by assignment specifications), several code inefficiencies were identified and optimized. This document details the improvements made, their rationale, and measurable impact.

## Improvement #1: Optimized Cart Total Price Calculation

### Issue Identified
**Location:** `models.py` - `Cart.get_total_price()` method (Line 36-40)  
**Severity:** MEDIUM üü°  
**Category:** Algorithm Efficiency

### Problem Description

The original implementation used a **nested loop** to calculate cart totals:
```python
def get_total_price(self):
    total = 0
    for item in self.items.values():
        for i in range(item.quantity):  # Inefficient nested loop!
            total += item.book.price
    return total
```

**Why This Is Inefficient:**

- **Unnecessary Iteration:** If a book has quantity = 50, the inner loop runs 50 times adding the same price repeatedly
- **Time Complexity:** O(n √ó m) where n = number of different books, m = average quantity
- **Should Be:** O(n) - just iterate once per unique book

**Example:**
- Book costs $10.99, quantity = 50
- Inefficient: Adds $10.99 fifty times in a loop
- Efficient: Multiplies $10.99 √ó 50 once

### Detection Method

**Tools Used:**
- ‚úÖ `timeit` module for benchmarking
- ‚úÖ `cProfile` for profiling function calls

**Performance Test Results (Before Optimization):**
```python
# Test with high quantities (50 books each, 4 different titles = 200 items total)
Cart calculation time: 5.49ms

# With quantities of 25-30 books
Average time (100 runs): 0.19ms per operation
```

While these times seem acceptable, they scale **linearly with quantity** rather than being constant-time for the multiplication operation.

### Optimized Solution

**AFTER (Optimized Code):**
```python
def get_total_price(self):
    total = 0
    for item in self.items.values():
        total += item.book.price * item.quantity  # Direct multiplication!
    return total
```

**OR even better, using sum():**
```python
def get_total_price(self):
    return sum(item.book.price * item.quantity for item in self.items.values())
```

### Performance Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Time Complexity | O(n √ó m) | O(n) | Algorithmic |
| Operations (50 qty) | 50 additions | 1 multiplication | 50√ó fewer operations |
| Execution Time | 5.49ms | ~2ms (estimated) | ~60% faster |
| Code Lines | 5 lines | 2 lines | 60% less code |
| Readability | Medium | High | More Pythonic |

### Why This Matters

**Current Impact:** 
- With small quantities (1-10), difference is negligible
- App currently performs well

**Future Scalability:**
- With bulk orders (quantity 100+), inefficiency compounds
- E-commerce sites often have high-quantity orders
- Better algorithm = better user experience as business grows

### Implementation Notes

**Status:** ‚úÖ Code analyzed, optimization identified  
**Testing:** Performance tests confirm correct calculations  
**Risk:** LOW - Simple mathematical equivalence  
**Effort:** 5 minutes to implement

## Improvement #2: Replaced Linear Search with Helper Function

### Issue Identified
**Location:** `app.py` - `add_to_cart()` function (Lines 54-62)

### Problem Description

Original code used manual loop to find books:
```python
# BEFORE: Manual linear search
book = None
for b in BOOKS:
    if b.title == book_title:
        book = b
        break
```

**Why This Is Suboptimal:**
- Code duplication (same logic could be reused)
- Less maintainable
- Helper function `get_book_by_title()` already exists!

### Optimized Solution
```python
# AFTER: Use existing helper function
book = get_book_by_title(book_title)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ‚úÖ More readable
- ‚úÖ Easier to maintain
- ‚úÖ Consistent with project structure

**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (Done while fixing Bug #1)

## Improvement #3: Removed Unused Instance Variables

### Issue Identified
**Location:** `models.py` - `User.__init__()` method

### Problem Description
```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, email, password, name="", address=""):
        self.email = email
        self.password = password
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.orders = []
        self.temp_data = []  # ‚ùå NEVER USED
        self.cache = {}      # ‚ùå NEVER USED
```

**Impact:**
- Wastes memory (small, but unnecessary)
- Confuses developers (what are these for?)
- Code smell - suggests incomplete refactoring

### Optimized Solution
```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, email, password, name="", address=""):
        self.email = email
        self.password = password
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.orders = []
        # Removed unused temp_data and cache
```

**Status:** üîú Recommended for implementation

## Improvement #4: Optimized Order History Sorting

### Issue Identified
**Location:** `models.py` - `User.add_order()` method

### Problem Description
```python
def add_order(self, order):
    self.orders.append(order)
    self.orders.sort(key=lambda x: x.order_date)  # Sorts EVERY time!
```

**Why This Is Inefficient:**
- Sorts the entire list every time an order is added
- Time complexity: O(n log n) for each addition
- Most users will have orders already in chronological order

### Optimized Solution

**Option 1:** Sort only when retrieving
```python
def add_order(self, order):
    self.orders.append(order)
    # Don't sort here!

def get_order_history(self, sort=True):
    if sort:
        return sorted(self.orders, key=lambda x: x.order_date, reverse=True)
    return self.orders
```

**Option 2:** Use bisect for insertion
```python
import bisect

def add_order(self, order):
    bisect.insort(self.orders, order, key=lambda x: x.order_date)
```

**Status:** üîú Recommended for implementation
